# Project Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project documentation:

1. **Run the Setup Script**:
   - For Windows: Execute `setup.bat` by running it in the command prompt.
   - For Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS): Execute `setup.sh` in the terminal.

2. **Activate the Python Virtual Environment**:
   - Run the command `source venv/bin/activate` (Unix) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) to activate the virtual environment.

3. **Launch MkDocs Server**:
   - Execute the command `mkdocs serve` to start the MkDocs web server. This command serves the project documentation locally.
